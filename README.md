I figured out the shortest path function! It took me 5 hours and lots of cout << "here" << endl; to figure out a line of code was in a loop when it should've been out of the loop. It's 11:00pm on Wednesday night but now that the shortest path function is done I'll try to do the minimum spanning path and hopefully get that finished before I go to bed.

I couldn't get to the minimum spanning path part of this project. I was basing my shortest path function off of one I found in a book but they did it in Ruby which doesn't translate very well to C++. I'm still going to work on it more today since it's not due for another 6 hours but I don't think that'll be enough time to finish the minimum spanning path unless I figure out the shortest path stuff soon.
