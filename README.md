Update 2

I tried but I couldn't get the minimum spanning tree finished. I think I made this project a lot harder for myself by using strings in my graph instead of just integers because there were several times where problems I was having could've been fixed by comparing integers but by the time I had realized I should probably change it I had already spent so long working on it. It's late/early so I'm going to stop working on this. I uploaded my design PDF where I drew some pictures and I also included the file where I was working on the minimum spanning tree function. Hope you have a good break!

I figured out the shortest path function! It took me 5 hours and lots of cout << "here" << endl; to figure out a line of code was in a loop when it should've been out of the loop. It's 11:00pm on Wednesday night but now that the shortest path function is done I'll try to do the minimum spanning tree and hopefully get that finished before I go to bed.

I couldn't get to the minimum spanning tree part of this project. I was basing my shortest path function off of one I found in a book but they did it in Ruby which doesn't translate very well to C++. I'm still going to work on it more today since it's not due for another 6 hours but I don't think that'll be enough time to finish the minimum spanning tree unless I figure out the shortest path stuff soon.
